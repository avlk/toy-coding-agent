{feedback_text}

Based on the feedback above, have the goals been met? Respond with only one word: Yes or No.

If there are any unmet goals, respond with No. 
If there are any issues higher then Minor, return No.
If some goals are only partially (or mostly) met, respond with No.

If the goals are met, all tests pass and only Minor or cosmetic corrections are left to be done, respond with Yes.
