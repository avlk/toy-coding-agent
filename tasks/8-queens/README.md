# 8 Queens Task

This is the simplest task in the set. It asks the agent to solve the 8 Queens problem and print all solutions.

With no requirement for unit tests, it is solvable even by the gemini-2.5-flash-lite model.

Adding a requirement for unit tests would make the task quite hard even for gemini-2.5-flash, which we don't want.
