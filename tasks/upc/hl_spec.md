Write a code to generate UPC bar codes. The bar code symbology shall be Code 128-B. 

The code shall be printed out in ASCII characters and shall be readable with smartphone. 

The code will be printed to a terminal working in a dark theme. Use terminal escape sequences to change default colour of symbols and background for the program output so that the barcode is displayed with **black** lines on **white** background. Provide solid white start and stop fields around the code (at least 10 characters). The code shall be at least 12 lines high. 
Use spaces (' ') to code 00, full block characters ('█', U+2588) to code 11, left half block ('▌', U+258C) to code 01 and right half block ('▐', U+2590) to encode 10 bar code patterns.

A set of unit tests shall be provided. Make sure that there is a unit test that ensures that the codes generated by the program are actually decodable.

The program shall print the bar code for the string that is provided to the input, or for "Agentic AI" if nothing is provided.
Parameters starting with -- are not considered an input to be decoded.
When run with --test parameter, it prints the default bar code and runs all tests. 

The use of external libraries to render bar codes is not allowed for the task completion.
