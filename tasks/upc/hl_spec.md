Write a code to generate UPC bar codes. The bar code symbology shall be Code 128-B. 

The code shall be printed out in ASCII characters and shall be readable with smartphone. 

Use spaces (' '), full block characters ('█', U+2588), left half block (U+258C) and right half block (U+2590) to encode bar code lines. The code will be printed with white characters on the black field, therefore it shall be printed inverted. Provide solid white field around the code. The code shall be at least 12 lines high. 
Provide at least 8 whitefield characters to the left and to the right of the code.

A set of unit test shall be provided. Make sure that there is a unit test that ensures that the codes generated by the program are actually decodable.

The program shall print the bar code for the string that is provided to the input, or for "Agentic AI" if nothing is provided.
Parameters starting with -- are not considered an input to be decoded.
When run with --test parameter, it prints the default bar code and runs all tests. 

The use of external libraries to render bar codes is not allowed for the task completion.
