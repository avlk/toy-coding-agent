# C-like interpreter

This is a medium range creative task. It asks the agent to design a simple C-like language, create an interpreter of it and provide unit tests.

It is solvable by the gemini-2.5-flash model, but not every time. It will take 10-15 iteration to complete.

With gemini-3-pro-preview, it will likely complete in 4-5 iteration, and Gemini 3 will use probably 5 times less tokens for coding.
