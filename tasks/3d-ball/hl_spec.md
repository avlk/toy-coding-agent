Write code to render an image of a ball with shadow into a text file of NxM characters with ASCII art. 

The ball has N/4 radius and is in the middle of a picture.

The ball is located on a horizontal plane with light source from the top left corner.

The ball has a shadow on the bottom right.

N and M are commandline arguments, but have default values of 80 and 120 respectively.

No colours are needed, just ASCII characters.

Take into account that the characters are taller than they are wide, the ratio is approximately 2:1 height to width.

The program should print the image.

Make sure that the tests are runnable by using the code_execution tool before submitting the result.
